<!-- Task 1

Objective: Learn how to access HTML elements using JavaScript and dynamically modify their attributes in response to user events like click or mouseover.
Description: Create a simple interactive webpage that displays an image representing daytime. When the user clicks a button, the image should be changed to nighttime — and the button text should be updated accordingly (Like initially button text should be “night”, and image should be daytime, when user clicks on button its text changes to “day” and images changes to night time). Additionally, when the user hovers over the image, its appearance (e.g., border or shadow) should change using inline CSS modifications. -->

Objective: Practice replacing content dynamically within HTML elements triggered by JavaScript events.
